This course brings you the latest best practices on how to create value with your customers and new business opportunities. In a market, where products and services are rapidly becoming commodities and where customers demand greater added value and better prices, the conventional approach to selling has to be revised. Now, a new approach to develop business opportunities with customer is needed based on co-creating value rather than on selling value. Sales people have to become much more strategic in their approach focussing on helping customer to achieve their business outcomes based on close and deep collaboration between their organisation and their customers. What is this program about? During the first day the participants will learn how they can engage customers and Co-Create Value with them rather then sell value to them. We will do this by playing a serious game on Co-Creation. The second day will focus on Design Thinking and how it can help you to design new services to co-creatie value with your customers. We will do this through a series of workshops where the participants will work on one of their own cases. Who is this program for? Sales and marketing managers who want to know more about the latest trends, tools and cases in business development Innovation managers who are looking for new innovative ways to engage and co-create value with their customers Sales executives who are looking for new proceses and tools to co-create value with their customers.
